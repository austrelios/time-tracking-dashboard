Time Tracking Dashboard - Frontend Mentor Challenge

This is one of the challenges from Frontend Mentor. It's a junior level challenge that allows you to try the following:
 - use a grid
 - display elements on top of each other
 - the challenge also allows you to use data from a json file, however, I haven't implemented this ability
